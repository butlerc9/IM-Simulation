# Sudoku Simulated Annealing: Duality of Non-Symmetric 9-State Potts Model

In this experiment the metropolis algorithm combined with simulated annealing was used to investigate the change in energy of a 2D ising model. This code was then adapted and was directly applied to the solution of Sudoku puzzles of various difficulties. Comparisons between the 9-State Potts model are also evident from the second order phase change which occurs at a temperature of 0.75

Sudoku has proved to be an insightful tool to help us explore more unique aspects of magnetic behaviour. Second order phase transitions were observed in both the Ising model and Sudoku puzzles. However the critical temperature for Sudoku was only calculated to be 0.75 whereas the Ising model had a temperature of ($2.5\pm 0.3$) with a theoretical critical temperature of 2.27.
## Getting Started

To use this code you must run the code in `randommatrixgeneratr.py` and import isingfunctions and `randommatrixgenerator.py`. These will import the code nessesscary to make the code. 

### Prerequisites

A fresh installation of python etc. On top of this youll need the default packages numpy,scipy,matplotlib etc.

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
